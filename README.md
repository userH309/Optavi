This app lets you download ads. You can sort between them, add quickly add them to favourites and look at them offline. You can also toogle between favourites and non favourites.

It uses pods like Alamofire for json requests, SDWebImage for efficient image handling and HidingNavigationBar for smooth behaviour while scrolling.
